# RikiTrakiWS

This repository contains the code for the web services supporting my personal hiking log: [RikiTraki.com](http://rikitraki.com). The data will be hosted on a MongoDB database to which this project provides a CRUD interface using REST web services.

**NOTE: RikiTrakiWS is in the early stages of development**

**TO DO:**

1. GET methods to replace static interface
2. Find hosting for MongoDB and REST services
3. Replace current RikiTraki static with REST interface
4. Authenticated POST for adding new tracks
5. User registration
